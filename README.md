# GitX

GitX is a lightweight and efficient Git clone built using Go (Golang). It is part of my ongoing series of deep-dive projects, where I aim to continuously improve and explore advanced technical concepts.

## Why GitX?

GitX is designed to offer an alternative implementation of Git functionalities while diving deeper into the mechanics of version control systems. By building it from scratch, I aim to gain a comprehensive understanding of distributed version control and contribute to the open-source ecosystem.

## Features (Planned and Implemented)

- **Basic Git Commands:** Support for essential commands like init, add, commit, and log
- **Branching and Merging:** Effective handling of code branching and merging
- **Efficient Storage:** Optimized storage of repository data
- **Cross-Platform Support:** Seamless usage across major operating systems
- **Performance Enhancements:** Continuous optimization for better performance

## Roadmap

- Implement support for remote repositories
- Optimize storage and data handling
- Add a user-friendly CLI interface
- Support advanced Git commands (rebase, stash, etc.)
- Comprehensive testing and benchmarking

## Installation

To install GitX, you'll need Go installed on your system. Follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ABHINAV-JHA-27/gitx.git
cd gitx
make build  # or go install
```

## Usage

After installation, you can initialize a GitX repository using:

```bash
gitx init
```

Other commands will be added as development progresses.

## Deep Dive Learning

This project is part of my continuous learning journey where I explore complex system-level programming challenges. I will regularly update GitX and document my learning process.
